Figuring out what to build was tougher than I thought. Compared to my Ruby on Rails Project, I knew what I wanted to build while learning the materail so building the project took less time with brainstorming ideas. With this JavaScript project, I just went ahead and built a low effort, meme website.

## What is it?
Here's the rep: https://github.com/plabradorjr/stock_js_project

This One-Page Minimum Viable Product is designed for tracking the 24-hour top gainers of the US stock market. The backend scrapes Yahoo Finance, then stores the data into my own database. The rails backend then generates its own API for the frontend JavaScript to fetch. A user can then post a comment for the day's current top stock gainers. The data is refreshed and deleted daily.

At this time, the narrative of the frontend is memetic. In the future, the skills I've used to make this MVP can scrape multiple data to generate a more useful stock trading insights.


## Skills I learned
Although the front is only one pager, learning JavaScript is fun. I learned how manipulating the DOM through javascript can create a much better user experience. Everthing just goes so fast and seamless. The ability to create my own rails API stregthened my knowlege of how to interact with an API. 

When I first started this bootcamp, I coudn't grasp the concept of an API. After building my own API and using JS to interact with it, my knowlege of API just became so much clearer. Definitely not an expert yet, but I am now in the point where I can read other website's API documentations and get a good grasp of the concepts. I'm really happy about that.
