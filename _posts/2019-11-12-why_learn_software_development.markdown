When asked what we want in life, we all pretty much have the same answers. To be financially stable, to have awesome relationships, to have a fulfilling career, to have good health, to contribute to society, to be happy, to have freedom, etc. 

Why do we want to do something is the easy question. It’s asking for pleasure. And "pleasure" questions ultimately have similar answers per person. The hard question is the the “pain” question. The answer no longer becomes the same per individual. The answer to that question is what makes you you, and me me. That’s the question that will get you somewhere.

> “How do you want to suffer?”<br>
> “What pain do you want to sustain?”

That is a more important question but often makes people tilt their head, raise a unilateral eyebrow, and wonder what in the world does that even mean. 

People want to play the guitar like a boss, but don’t want to go through the pain of consistently practicing chords. People want to climb the corporate ladder but don’t want the pain of long hours and office politics. People want the benefits, but not the cost. Those who are willing to go through the pain are the ones who reap the benefits. Many experts ultimately aim towards the best pain of their life. To most of these experts, what looks like hard work from the outside, is play from the inside. 

After over 6 years working as a registered nurse, I can no longer count the code blues and true medical emergency cases I've participated in. Life and death situations. As stressful they can be, it's these critical moments that you can make the biggest difference in someone's life. Moments like that bring meaning to my life. However, I'm choosing to change my struggles for now. I want to try a new branch of path that I think may be more aligned with my genuine curiosities, excitement, and intuition. 

On my days off, I tend to gravitate towards learning how to build websites. The first website I built was a study guide for student nurses. The goal was to help students pass their local college exams and eventually the board exam with less stress. When I first thought about building that project, I had no clue where to start. I know nothing.

I first tried to learn basic HTML and CSS. Luckily, I discovered Wordpress and it solved all my immediate problems. For someone with no coding background, it was like discovering Nirvana. Music to my ears. Caviar on my plate. You get the metaphor. With todays tools, I experienced how simple it could be to create a minimum viable website with Wordpress and plug-ins, while not knowing how to code.

### It's easy to start, what's hard is to stay. 

Within a few months, I finished my very first fully functioning website with responsive quizes, drip contents, membership tiers, PayPal/Stripe integration, monthly subscriptions, etc. Also got lucky to get a few users and paying customers. The idea in my head suddenly turned real, and it was a nice feeling. Woot! I do know some things now.

Just like everyone else, I also realized how little I know. I made a website fast and alone. But after 2 years of leaving that site passive, the tradeoff to further develop the site wasn't impressive. I decided to take it down. 

Stumbling into the concept of Blockchain and Ethereum tokens is when I really considered to learn software development. This crypto thing, I don't get it, no one really understands it, but I dig it. I stumbled into a software developer kit for an Ethereum token, and the documentation wants me to use javascript and API. I have no idea how to use them. "I’ve had enough!", slightly screamed my ambitious brain. I should probably go ahead and learn software development with professionals' help and structured classes. 

I don’t know how good I will be with coding. What I don't want to do is force a career that I'm not naturally good at or make halfhearted attempts. Even if I fail, I'd be ok. And that's because the alternative is much worse. The alternative is regret. I'm ok with failure, but I won't be ok for not taking any action. 

I hope to build some pretty awesome software for the world. But desire doesn't really figure much. Many bright minds argue that skills trump passion when finding the work you love. It wont be easy, but I’m here to stay and improve for more.

For the first time in a while, I'm excited again and I look forward to the future.
