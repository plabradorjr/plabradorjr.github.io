Although this is a very small app, with very little commands, I finally felt like I was actually programming. 


## What does the CLI do?

* It scrapes coinmarketcap.com. 
* It creates an instance for each 100 coins listed from the homepage of coinmarketcap.com
* When you run the CLI, it will ask leading questions so you can interact with app.

## It's better explained on this video:

## Where's the code at?
I made two branches, a master file and the other is a branch that is (I think) more aligned with flatiron requirements.
