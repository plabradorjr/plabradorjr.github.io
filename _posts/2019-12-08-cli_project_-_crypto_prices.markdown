## What does this CLI do?

* It scrapes coinmarketcap.com. 
* It creates an instance for each 100 coins listed from the homepage of coinmarketcap.com
* It'll show you cryptocurrency prices, ranks, volumes, and such in a fancy looking colorized table. 
* As you run the CLI, it will ask leading questions so you can interact with app.
 
## Here's an explainer video:

## Where's the code at?
I made two branches, a master file and the other is a branch that is (I think) more aligned with flatiron requirements.
